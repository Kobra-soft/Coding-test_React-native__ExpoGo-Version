npm install

npx expo start

These 2 commands will install all the modules / packages required to run the app.

The 2nd command will allow you to test the application on ExpoGo via a simulator such as ANDROID STUDIO / iOS SIMULATOR.

This app has been fully tested and developed for both platforms on iOS and Android devices both via simulator's and physical devices.

You may need to install ExpoGo globally on your computer to be able to see and test the app, this react native mobile app build requires SDK51 or above to work! which of now is the latest SDK so you may need to update your version of ExpoGo either on your phone or via your simulator.
